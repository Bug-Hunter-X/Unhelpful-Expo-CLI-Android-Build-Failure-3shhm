# Unhelpful Expo CLI Android Build Failure

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The build process fails without providing clear error messages, making it challenging to identify and resolve the underlying problem.

## Problem Description

When attempting to build an Android APK using `expo build:android`, the build process unexpectedly fails. The error messages provided by the Expo CLI are often insufficient to diagnose the root cause. This makes debugging very time-consuming and frustrating.  The error might indicate a general build failure without specific details.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining the Gradle build logs and identifying the precise error.  Common causes include incorrect configurations within the `android/` directory of the Expo project.  The provided solution (`build.gradle.solution`) shows typical corrections.
